# Welcome!
BIDS Manager is a PyQt-based **GUI** that converts **DICOM** folders into **BIDS-compliant** datasets and allows easy metadata editing. It also includes several tools for editing, managing and visualizing your BIDS datasets. 

BIDS Manager was developed by the [Applied Neurocognitive Psychology Lab (ANCP Lab)](https://uol.de/en/applied-neurocognitive-psychology) as a free, open-science tool designed to be as **user-friendly** as possible.

```{admonition} Windows update!
:class: tip

Currently, BIDS-Manager runs smoothly both on Linux and Windows! ðŸš€

```

This documentation includes an installation guide and a tutorial on how to use the different modules within BIDS-manager, and it doesn't require deep technical programming knowledge.

## Requirements for this tutorial
* Basic understanding of [BIDS](./extra/bids).
* Python 3.10 (installed automatically with BIDS-Manager if not already available).
* A DICOM datasetâ€” if you donâ€™t have one, a [dummy dataset](./extra/download) is available so you can follow along with the tutorial.

## I've got a question!
If you have any questions or encounter difficulties while working with BIDS Manager, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us. You can send an e-mail to karel.mauricio.lopez.vilaret@uni-oldenburg.de or check a `New Issue` in the [BIDS-Manager github](https://github.com/ANCPLabOldenburg/BIDS-Manager/issues).
